Single Page Web Scraper (inspired by Dataquest)
-----------------------------------------------

In this project, I retrieved data on films listed on the [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) website.
On the IMDb website, users can find information about films, television shows, film cast and crew, awards, and IMDb's recommendations.
Users then can research on many aspects of media, such as release date, rating, Metascore, IMDb's rating, votes, box office numbers, and much more.

I wanted to start applying and finding out techniques on how to start retrieving data from websites - utilising requests to make HTTP requests and access data from the website, and using BeautifulSoup to parse and extract HTML and XML documents.

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Download and run data-retrieval program

* Clone this repo to your computer.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Run `python main.py`

#### Analyse the data

* After running `python main.py`, run `analyse.py`

### Install the requirements

* Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  * Create a virtual environment (optional)

Extending this
--------------

Any feedback and comments are greatly welcome.
I am planning to work on a multipage version of this, and then proceeding to generate insights on the data collected.
